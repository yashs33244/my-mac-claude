description: Generate a structured weekly or monthly review note from vault history
---

Use the obsidian-second-brain skill. Execute `/obsidian-review $ARGUMENTS`:

The optional argument specifies `weekly` or `monthly`. Ask if not clear from context.

1. Read `_CLAUDE.md` first if it exists in the vault root
2. Determine the period: weekly or monthly
3. Read daily notes and dev logs for the period
4. Read active projects and check for status changes
5. Read completed tasks from kanban boards
6. Draft a review note using `Templates/Review.md` if it exists, otherwise use:
   - What I accomplished
   - Key decisions made
   - People I worked with
   - What I learned
   - What to carry forward
7. Save to `Reviews/YYYY-MM-DD — Weekly Review.md` (or Monthly)
8. Link from the last daily note of the period

**AI-first rule:** Every note created or updated by this command MUST follow `references/ai-first-rules.md` — `## For future Claude` preamble, rich frontmatter (`type`, `date`, `tags`, `ai-first: true`, plus type-specific fields), recency markers per external claim, mandatory `[[wikilinks]]` for every person/project/concept referenced, sources preserved verbatim with URLs inline, and confidence levels where applicable. The vault is for future-Claude retrieval — not human reading.
