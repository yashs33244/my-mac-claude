description: Automatic synthesis — scans the vault for unnamed patterns and writes synthesis pages without being asked
---

Use the obsidian-second-brain skill. Execute `/obsidian-synthesize`:

This command can run manually or as a scheduled agent. It thinks for you.

1. Read `_CLAUDE.md` first if it exists in the vault root
2. Read `index.md` to understand all existing pages
3. Read `log.md` (last 20 entries) to see recent vault activity

4. Scan for synthesis opportunities — spawn parallel subagents:

   - **Cross-source agent**: read all sources ingested in the last 7 days (`raw/`). Find concepts that appear in 2+ unrelated sources. If the same idea shows up in a podcast transcript AND an article AND a daily note — that's a synthesis candidate.
   
   - **Entity convergence agent**: scan `wiki/entities/` for people who appear together in multiple contexts but have no explicit connection page. If Person A and Person B keep showing up in the same projects/decisions — write a connection note.
   
   - **Concept evolution agent**: scan `wiki/concepts/` for ideas that have been updated 3+ times. Track how the concept evolved — write a "Concept Evolution" section showing the timeline of how the user's thinking changed.
   
   - **Orphan rescue agent**: find notes in `wiki/` with no incoming links that contain claims or ideas that SHOULD be linked to existing pages. Create the missing links and explain why.

5. For each synthesis found:
   - Create `wiki/concepts/Synthesis — Title.md` with:
     ```yaml
     ---
     date: YYYY-MM-DD
     tags:
       - concept
       - synthesis
     auto_generated: true
     ---
     ```
   - Document: what pattern was found, which sources/notes it came from (with links), what it means, and a suggested action
   - Link the synthesis page FROM all the source notes it references

6. Update `index.md` with new synthesis pages
7. Append to `log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] synthesize | X synthesis pages created, Y orphans rescued, Z connections found`
8. If a daily note exists for today, add a Synthesis section with a brief summary

The vault should generate its own insights. Not just when asked — on its own schedule.

**AI-first rule:** Every note created or updated by this command MUST follow `references/ai-first-rules.md` — `## For future Claude` preamble, rich frontmatter (`type`, `date`, `tags`, `ai-first: true`, plus type-specific fields), recency markers per external claim, mandatory `[[wikilinks]]` for every person/project/concept referenced, sources preserved verbatim with URLs inline, and confidence levels where applicable. The vault is for future-Claude retrieval — not human reading.
